# music4dance.net

This repository contains the code for https://www.music4dance.net, which is now under an MIT license.
Note that the data running on the site is _not_ included in that license.
We are currently investigating possible ways to open up the data, but haven't landed on a solution as of this writing.

## Contributing

### Data & Finance

You can contribute to music4dance either by helping add and tag songs in the database or by purchasing a subscription.
Details are available on the [website](https://www.music4dance.net/home/contribute).

### Bug reports

If you have a GitHub account, you can file bugs and feature requests [here](https://github.com/music4dance/music4dance/issues/new?template=bug_report.yaml).

- [Bug reports](https://github.com/music4dance/music4dance/issues/new?template=bug_report.yaml) for code issues on the website
- [Feature requests](https://github.com/music4dance/music4dance/issues/new?template=feature_request.yaml) for new features
- [Data Errors](https://github.com/music4dance/music4dance/issues/new?template=data_error.yaml) for issues with the songs and text on the site

We realize that not everyone who uses the music4dance website will want to create a GitHub account to file issues, so we will
continue to provide a [simpler reporting option](https://music4dance.blog/bug-report/) on the site.

### Code

Even though the project is now open source, there are some additional hurdles to getting sandboxed development environments set up.
If you are interested in contributing code, please create a feature with your idea and note that you would like to implement it. That will increase
the priority of figuring out ways to get past the blocking issues.

## Deployment

For information on deploying this application to Azure Linux Web Apps (including self-contained deployment for .NET 10), see [SELF_CONTAINED_DEPLOYMENT.md](SELF_CONTAINED_DEPLOYMENT.md).
