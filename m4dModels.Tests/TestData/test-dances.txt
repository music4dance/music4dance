CFT	[Vernon and Irene Castle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernon_and_Irene_Castle) were early ballroom dancers who were strongly associated with the [Foxtrot].  The [Foxtrot] evolved over time and the modern variations danced in a ballroom settings range from a medium tempo ([Slow Foxtrot]) to very fast ([Quickstep]).  \r\n\r\nAt music4dance our use of the term *Castle Foxtrot* is a proxy for Foxtrot-like dances that are danced more slowly even than the [Slow Foxtrot].  This is particularly interesting in the context of [first dances](https://www.music4dance.net/song/addtags?tags=%2BFirst+Dance:Other) at weddings which are often danced to songs in this tempo range and called generically *Slow Dance*.  \r\n\r\nIf you're looking for music to *Slow Dance* to for your [first](https://www.music4dance.net/song/addtags?tags=%2BFirst+Dance:Other), [mother/son](https://www.music4dance.net/song/addtags?tags=%2BMother+Son:Other) or [father/daughter](https://www.music4dance.net/song/addtags?tags=%2BFather+Daughter:Other) dance at your wedding, our list of Castle Foxtrot [wedding songs](https://www.music4dance.net/song/addtags?tags=%2BWedding:Other&filter=Index-CFT-Dances) is a good place to start.\r\n	1/1/0001 12:00 AM	9fb98463-7d0c-4d2c-a528-292a151472ce	Vernon and Irene Castle	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernon_and_Irene_Castle

This give the cha cha both its characteristic rhythm (2, 3,4 & 1) and its onomatopoeic name (two  three Cha Cha one).\r\n\r\nThe *Cha Cha* is generally danced as the first dance of [American Rhythm] and second dance of the [International Latin] five dance competitions.\r\n	1/1/0001 12:00 AM

LTN	In competitive ballroom dance the term Latin has a very specific meaning as the five dances that are danced as [International  Latin Five Dance] round. This round consists of [Cha Cha], [Samba], [Rumba], [Paso  Doble] and [Jive].    \r\n\r\nSince our main purpose is match music to styles of dance, this isn't a particularly useful categorization. Instead, we are broadly grouping the dance styles that derive from Spain and Latin America as Latin. This gives a useful spectrum of tempos of similarly styled music that can be mapped to the various *Latin* dances. Note that we've pulled out the [Tango]s into their own category as there enough different styles of Tango each danced to similar music at slightly different tempi that they create a cohesive unit. There is some argument that the same should be done for other sub-groups of *Latin* dances and music.  For instance [Bolero], International [Rumba] and American Rumba create a spectrum of  tempi from about 25 to 36 measures per minute all danced to a similar style music. And [Samba] and [Bossa Nova] create a natural subcategory of Brazilian music with a similar feel at different tempi.	1/1/0001 12:00 AM	54a8362f-9ab0-439d-97c0-b7e870796765	International Latin Round	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_DanceSport_dances#Latin

SWG	The group of dance styles that are traditionally danced to [Swing music] and trace their roots to the American nineteen twenties dance tradition centered in the [Savoy Ballroom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savoy_Ballroom) are collectively known as *Swing* dances. These dances range from formal ballroom dances in both [American Rhythm] ([East Coast Swing]) and [International Latin] ([Jive]) syllabi to the more social variants of [Lindy Hop] and [West Coast Swing]. There are also many regional variants of swing including but definitely not limited to [Balboa] and [Carolina Shag].	1/1/0001 12:00 AM	32c84c48-40cb-49d8-8413-414d58282fab	Wikipedia	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_(dance)	61f200f1-6d4d-445d-8fda-9785891f3dc2	Savoy Ballroom	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savoy_Ballroom
SWZ	The Slow Waltz is a dance in 3/4 time and is characterized by its graceful rise and fall motion.  It is danced primarily in closed position to the music of the same name.  At music4dance, we're be consistently referring to this dance as the *Slow Waltz* to distinguish it from the [Viennese Waltz] and other dances in the [Waltz] family, but in the context of ballroom dancing when the term *Waltz* is used by itself, this is generally the dance that is being referenced.\r\n\r\nThe Slow Waltz is generally danced first in both the [American Smooth] and [International Standard] dance competitions.  	1/1/0001 12:00 AM	470c54f7-3412-4c49-ba5b-9b22b16c2d32	Wikipedia	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waltz	693e1bb7-9662-4117-9d9e-aeaab244f6c4	Wikipedia	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_waltz	3a8fc772-4e40-45d2-8bed-f8b18519a2fe	Technique	http://www.ehow.com/how_4302_waltz.html

TAP	Here at music4dance.net we're busily cataloging music with a specific interest in what dance styles 'work' with the music.  Since we come from a partner dancing background our system is set up primarily to work with traditional ballroom and partner social dancing like Swing, Salsa and Tango all of which are danced to music of a specific meter and tempo.  But with the interest in shows like *So You Think You Can Dance* and *Dancing With the Stars*, styles like Broadway, Contemporary, Jazz and even Ballet and Tap have started to show up in our database.  None of these style of dance operate under the same meter and tempo constraints that we are using, so we're creating initial place-holders for those styles and others that we'll roughly call 'performace' dances while we figure out how to generalize our website for such dance styles.	1/1/0001 12:00 AM
