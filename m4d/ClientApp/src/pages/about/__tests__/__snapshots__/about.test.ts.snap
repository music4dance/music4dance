      <h2>About music4dance</h2>
      <p><b>music4dance</b> is a project that has been floating around in my head in various forms since I first started ballroom dancing - so what <i>is</i> music4dance, really? </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>music4dance</b> is meant to help find music to dance to as well has help figure out what dances can be danced to a piece of music </li>
        <li><b>music4dance</b> intended to help DJs find new music to add to their playlists as well as for students and teachers to build playlists to practice to </li>
        <li><b>music4dance</b> meant to help dancers understand the relationship between dance and the music that they dance to </li>
        <li><b>music4dance</b> a place for people to find music to dance to for special occassions like weddings and holidy parties </li>
      </ul>
      <p> Even to make a dent in any one of those goals is pretty ambitious. That's about all I've done is to make a dent. I certainly haven't solved any of these problems to my satisfaction. So most of all music4dance is a work in progress and a playground for me to experiment with the intersection of three of my lifelong passions - music, dance and programming. </p>
      <p> And while I'm doing that, I hope that music4dance provides at least a partial solution to some of the above for you. I'm sure that's true for some and I can say that some of the most interesting features of this site have started as questions from the community. So please keep using the site and <a href="https://music4dance.blog/feedback/">let me know</a> what you think. </p>
      <p class="neutral"> Please read my <a href="https://www.music4dance.blog">blog</a> for more about the history and motivation behind <a href="https://www.music4dance.net">music4dance</a>. </p>
      <h2>About David</h2>
      <p> I’m an amateur dancer and with some training in music who also happens to be a professional software engineer. I love dancing, and I particularly love dancing when I enjoy the music that I’m dancing to. </p>
      <p> My dance background is primarily in <a href="https://www.music4dance.net/dances/ballroom">Ballroom</a>. I’ve been an amateur competitor in the <a href="https://www.music4dance.net/dances/american-rhythm">American Rhythm style</a>. Recently I've moved more towards social partner dancing. As I was starting to work on music4dance in earnest, I dove into tap. </p>
      <p>Most of my programming time outside of my main day jobs has been related to music.</p>
      <ul>
        <li> When the Macintosh came out, my first thought was - Music Editor. And I wrote one - although I never got it to the point where I could sell it. </li>
        <li>My work study project in college was writing music theory software for the Macintosh</li>
        <li> When I left Corporate America to try my hand at the startup world I joined a company that was digitizing sheet music and did the initial work to take that online. </li>
        <li> When I left Corporate America for the second time to rediscover my love of programming (and generally find myself) I founded music4dance. </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Other Projects</h2>
      <ul>
        <li> I have a technical blog hosted on <a href="https://medium.com/@dwgray" target="_blank">Medium.com</a></li>
        <li> Other things I've been working on, including contributions to some of the open source projecdts that power music4dance, can be found my <a href="https://github.com/dwgray" target="_blank">github page.</a></li>
