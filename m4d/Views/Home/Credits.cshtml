    <li>Music4dance.net is built with <a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc">asp.net mvc core</a> using <a href="https://vuejs.org/">vue.js</a>, <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Twitter Bootstrap</a> and <a href="https://bootstrap-vue.org/">Bootstrap Vue</a> for the presentation layer, <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/sql-database/">SQL Azure</a> and <a href="http://www.asp.net/entity-framework">Entity Framework</a> for the database.</li>
    <ul>
        <li class="text-danger">NOTE: We're currently migrating from vue.js 2.0 to vue.js 3.0 and bootstrap-vue to bootstrap-vue-next.  The new pages should look very close to the old ones, but can be readily identified by the fact that the drop-down menus are rendered white text on a black background. We would appreciate your help as we roll the changes out. Please <a href="https://music4dance.blog/bug-report/">report any bugs you find</a> and we'll do our best to keep the site stable.</li>
        <li>We're still using <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> for form validation in the account pages, but hope to find an alternative as part of the general migration progress.</li>
