    "description": "In competitive ballroom dance the term Latin has a very specific meaning as the five dances that are danced as [International  Latin Five Dance] round. This round consists of [Cha Cha], [Samba], [Rumba], [Paso  Doble] and [Jive].    \r\n\r\nSince our main purpose is match music to styles of dance, this isn't a particularly useful categorization. Instead, we are broadly grouping the dance styles that derive from Spain and Latin America as Latin. This gives a useful spectrum of tempos of similarly styled music that can be mapped to the various *Latin* dances. Note that we've pulled out the [Tango]s into their own category as there enough different styles of Tango each danced to similar music at slightly different tempi that they create a cohesive unit. There is some argument that the same should be done for other sub-groups of *Latin* dances and music.  For instance [Bolero], International [Rumba] and American Rumba create a spectrum of  tempi from about 25 to 36 measures per minute all danced to a similar style music. And [Samba] and [Bossa Nova] create a natural subcategory of Brazilian music with a similar feel at different tempi.",

Elements of the Charleston were also pulled into early [Foxtrot] dancing to create the [Quickstep] variation of the Foxtrot.\r\n\r\nThe Charleston beat is considered a clave rhythm and was popularized by the song called \"The Charleston\" from the Musical *Runnin' Wild* by composer James P. Johnson.  Charleston is danced with an eight beat basic to 4/4 time at 200-300 beats per minute.\r\n",

Although the moves are somewhat different, for the purposed of finding music to dance to these are close enough to be grouped in the same category as the US versions of the Hustle.",

Like its cousin the [Tango (Ballroom)], it is a result of migration north and evolving outside of Argentina.  Unlike Ballroom Tango, Neo-Tango's birth is placed about the year 2000.  For our purposes, Neo-Tango includes all of the modern Tango Fusion variations like electrotango and alternative tango.\r\n\r\nWhile we haven't systematically added sub-categories to these dances, any registered user is welcome to use the [tag editor](https://www.music4dance.net/blog/music4dance-help/tag-editing/) to overlay their own sub-categories of Tango on the Neo-Tango [dance tag](https://www.music4dance.net/blog/music4dance-help/tag-definitions/).",

This is particularly interesting in the context of [first dances](https://www.music4dance.net/song/addtags?tags=%2BFirst+Dance:Other) at weddings which are often danced to songs in this tempo range and called generically *Slow Dance*.  \r\n\r\nIf you're looking for music to *Slow Dance* to for your [first](https://www.music4dance.net/song/addtags?tags=%2BFirst+Dance:Other), [mother/son](https://www.music4dance.net/song/addtags?tags=%2BMother+Son:Other) or [father/daughter](https://www.music4dance.net/song/addtags?tags=%2BFather+Daughter:Other) dance at your wedding, our list of Castle Foxtrot [wedding songs](https://www.music4dance.net/song/addtags?tags=%2BWedding:Other&filter=Index-CFT-Dances) is a good place to start.\r\n",

It is the first ballroom dance to be performed in the closed hold or \"waltz\" position and is distinguished from other *Waltzes* in that it is danced to a fast tempo and is strongly characterized by circular motion of the partners rotating around each other as they progress down line of dance.\r\n\r\n*Viennese Waltz* is generally danced as the fourth and final dance in [American Smooth four dance] and third in [International Standard five dance] competitions.
