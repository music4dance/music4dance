# tempo-counter

## TodoNext
- Optimize how we're loading third party components
- Refactor?  Can we put stuff further down in the dance heirarchy
- Get tempo info dynamically from the server
- Make click action on dance configurable (use a slot?)
- Manual tempo entry: Consider making MPM/BMP symetrical + enable mini-phrase/other phrases?
- Should we enable all (or some of) the parameters we had in the old control
