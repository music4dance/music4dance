      "description": "In competitive ballroom dance the term Latin has a very specific meaning as the five dances that are danced as [International  Latin Five Dance] round. This round consists of [Cha Cha], [Samba], [Rumba], [Paso  Doble] and [Jive].    \r\n\r\nSince our main purpose is match music to styles of dance, this isn't a particularly useful categorization. Instead, we are broadly grouping the dance styles that derive from Spain and Latin America as Latin. This gives a useful spectrum of tempos of similarly styled music that can be mapped to the various *Latin* dances. Note that we've pulled out the [Tango]s into their own category as there enough different styles of Tango each danced to similar music at slightly different tempi that they create a cohesive unit. There is some argument that the same should be done for other sub-groups of *Latin* dances and music.  For instance [Bolero], International [Rumba] and American Rumba create a spectrum of  tempi from about 25 to 36 measures per minute all danced to a similar style music. And [Samba] and [Bossa Nova] create a natural subcategory of Brazilian music with a similar feel at different tempi.",

          "description": "The *Mambo* is a fusion of Swing and Cuban music developed from Danzon and was heavily influenced by the Jazz musicians of the 1930s.  The competition dance was influenced by the Cuban music and style, but is formalized nearly beyond recognition.  It is characterized by breaking on the 2 in 4/4 time and a compact basic movement.\r\n\r\nThe *Mambo* is generally danced as the fifth and final  dance of [American Rhythm five dance] competitions.",

Elements of the Charleston were also pulled into early [Foxtrot] dancing to create the [Quickstep] variation of the Foxtrot.\r\n\r\nThe Charleston beat is considered a clave rhythm and was popularized by the song called \"The Charleston\" from the Musical *Runnin' Wild* by composer James P. Johnson.  Charleston is danced with an eight beat basic to 4/4 time at 200-300 beats per minute.\r\n",

Although the moves are somewhat different, for the purposed of finding music to dance to these are close enough to be grouped in the same category as the US versions of the Hustle.",

These dances evolved at the end of the nineteenth century in Buenos Aires and Montevideo and are danced to [Tango Music].\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of music4dance, we're using the category of Argentine Tango for what Argentine Tango dancers call just \"Tango.\"  It is a dance performed in a close embrace to traditional Tango music in 2/4 or 4/4 time.\r\n\r\nLike many dance styles, there is plenty of debate as to what to include an exclude in a category.  For our purposes, we're including most of what has over the years been termed Nuevo Tango music but placing [Neo Tango] in its own category.
