        <h4 class="blog">Question 2: What dance styles can I dance to my favorite song(s)?</h4>
        <p class="blog">One of the things that amazes me about the best dance teachers I know is that they seem to do this matching instinctively.  They hear the first bar or two of a song and immediately know which dance(s) to dance.  I imagine “instinct” in this case is some combination of natural talent, many hours of practice and the amount of time that they spend listening to music and thinking about how it fits with dance.</p>
