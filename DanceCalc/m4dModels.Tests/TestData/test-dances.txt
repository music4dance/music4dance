BBA	*Balboa* is an early member of the [Swing] dance family that originated in southern California.  It is a close hold dance and while it can be danced to many tempos, for the purpose of our catalog we will be using the faster end of the *Balboa* range for categorization (40-65 measures per minute).  	b361faa3-8555-47d6-b3eb-3902e11cd21e	Wikipedia	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balboa_(dance)

BOL	*Bolero* is unique among competitive American Rhythm dances in that it requires not only cuban motion, but contra body movement as found in the smooth dances and rise and fall as is found in the [waltz].   For the purpose of music4dance categorization Bolero is the slowest of the three competition dances that are danced to *Rumba* style music, the other two being the Rumbas from the [International Latin] and [American Rhythm] categories.\r\n\r\nThe Bolero is generally danced as the fourth dance of [American Rhythm five dance] competitions.  	0702588e-05e6-49e1-9434-0a0d5090eb64	Wikipedia	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolero#American_Rhythm

CHA	The *Cha Cha* is danced to the music of the same name introduced by Cuban composer and violinist Enrique Jordin in 1953. This rhythm was developed from the danzon by a syncopation of the fourth beat. The Cha Cha is danced in 4/4 time and the fourth beat is split in two.  This give the cha cha both its characteristic rhythm (2, 3,4 & 1) and its onomatopoeic name (two  three Cha Cha one).\r\n\r\nThe *Cha Cha* is generally danced as the first dance of [American Rhythm] and second dance of the [International Latin] five dance competitions.\r\n

LTN	In competitive ballroom dance the term Latin has a very specific meaning as the five dances that are danced as [International  Latin Five Dance] round. This round consists of [Cha Cha], [Samba], [Rumba], [Paso  Doble] and [Jive].    \r\n\r\nSince our main purpose is match music to styles of dance, this isn't a particularly useful categorization. Instead, we are broadly grouping the dance styles that derive from Spain and Latin America as Latin. This gives a useful spectrum of tempos of similarly styled music that can be mapped to the various *Latin* dances. Note that we've pulled out the [Tango]s into their own category as there enough different styles of Tango each danced to similar music at slightly different tempi that they create a cohesive unit. There is some argument that the same should be done for other sub-groups of *Latin* dances and music.  For instance [Bolero], International [Rumba] and American Rumba create a spectrum of  tempi from about 25 to 36 measures per minute all danced to a similar style music. And [Samba] and [Bossa Nova] create a natural subcategory of Brazilian music with a similar feel at different tempi.	54a8362f-9ab0-439d-97c0-b7e870796765	International Latin Round	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_DanceSport_dances#Latin
MBO	The *Mambo* is a fusion of Swing and Cuban music developed from Danzon and was heavily influenced by the Jazz musicians of the 1930s.  The competition dance was influenced by the Cuban music and style, but is formalized nearly beyond recognition.  It is characterized by breaking on the 2 in 4/4 time and a compact basic movement.\r\n\r\nThe *Mambo* is generally danced as the fifth and final  dance of [American Rhythm five dance] competitions.	b066f19f-c35d-4a4a-9b35-2fb888bb783e	Wikipedia	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mambo_(dance)

QST	The *Quickstep* or  evolved from in the 1920s from a combination of [Slow Foxtrot], The Chase G Chug, Charleston, Shag, [Peabody], and One-Step.  While it evolved from the [Slow Foxtrot], the Quickstep now is quite separate.  It is characterized by high-energy and a exhilarating sense of flight and gliding.\r\n\r\nThe *Quickstep* is generally danced as the fifth and final dance in [International Standard five dance] competitions.\r\n

RMB	There are two competition ballroom dances called *Rumba*.  One in the [International Latin] round that based on what the Cubans called bolero-son and is danced in a similar pattern to the American Style [Bolero] and the other in the [American Rhythm] round which is danced to a faster beat and takes a box step as its basic figure.  \r\n\r\nThe American Style Bolero (96-104 BPM), the International Rumba (100-108 BPM), and the American Rumba (120-144 BPM) are all in a subfamily of Latin dance that are danced to similar music at a range of tempi.\r\n\r\nThe *Rhumba* is generally danced as the second dance of [American Rhythm] and third dance of [International Latin] five dance competitions.	30f4859b-e897-4d21-9395-e6212fd0274a	Wikipedia	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumba_(dance)

SFT	The *Foxtrot* or *Slow Foxtrot* is characterized by long continuous flowing movements across the dance floor and is customarily danced to the same big band music as swing.  In the ballroom this dance is generally referred to as *Foxtrot* but here at music4dance, we are going to consistently use the modifier *Slow* to distinguish this dance from other dances in the [Foxtrot] family, such as the [Quickstep] and the [Castle Foxtrot] as well as allowing us to use the term [Foxtrot] to cover the entire family.\r\n\r\n*Slow Foxtrot* is generally danced third in [American Smooth four dance] and fourth in [International Standard five dance] competitions.\r\n\r\n\r\n

SWG	The group of dance styles that are traditionally danced to [Swing music] and trace their roots to the American nineteen twenties dance tradition centered in the [Savoy Ballroom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savoy_Ballroom) are collectively known as *Swing* dances. These dances range from formal ballroom dances in both [American Rhythm] ([East Coast Swing]) and [International Latin] ([Jive]) syllabi to the more social variants of [Lindy Hop] and [West Coast Swing]. There are also many regional variants of swing including but definitely not limited to [Balboa] and [Carolina Shag].	32c84c48-40cb-49d8-8413-414d58282fab	Wikipedia	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_(dance)	61f200f1-6d4d-445d-8fda-9785891f3dc2	Savoy Ballroom	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savoy_Ballroom
SWZ	The Slow Waltz is a dance in 3/4 time and is characterized by its graceful rise and fall motion.  It is danced primarily in closed position to the music of the same name.  At music4dance, we're be consistently referring to this dance as the *Slow Waltz* to distinguish it from the [Viennese Waltz] and other dances in the [Waltz] family, but in the context of ballroom dancing when the term *Waltz* is used by itself, this is generally the dance that is being referenced.\r\n\r\nThe Slow Waltz is generally danced first in both the [American Smooth] and [International] Standard dance competitions.  	470c54f7-3412-4c49-ba5b-9b22b16c2d32	Wikipedia	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waltz	693e1bb7-9662-4117-9d9e-aeaab244f6c4	Wikipedia	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_waltz	3a8fc772-4e40-45d2-8bed-f8b18519a2fe	Technique	http://www.ehow.com/how_4302_waltz.html

It is the first ballroom dance to be performed in the closed hold or "waltz" position and is distinguished from other *Waltzes* in that it is danced to a fast tempo and is strongly characterized by circular motion of the partners rotating around each other as they progress down line of dance.\r\n\r\n*Viennese Waltz* is generally danced as the fourth and final dance in [American Smooth four dance] and third in [International Standard five dance] competitions.  	a8c06aa1-e882-4f83-88b2-7ad21ec28ebc	Technique	http://dance.about.com/od/partnerdancestyles/qt/Viennese_Waltz.htm	52317102-c56e-4a84-ac9f-7e46c3dce8d9	History	http://www.austria.info/us/the-big-waltz-at-lincoln-center/history-of-the-viennese-waltz-1345134.html	5e2c4979-b373-44c1-9fa8-9670cdef29d9	Wikipedia	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viennese_Waltz
