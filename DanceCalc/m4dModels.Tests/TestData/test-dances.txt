BBA	*Balboa* is an early member of the <//Swing> dance family that originated in southern California.  It is a close hold dance and while it can be danced to many tempos, for the purpose of our catalog we will be using the faster end of the *Balboa* range for categorization (40-65 measures per minute).  	b361faa3-8555-47d6-b3eb-3902e11cd21e	Wikipedia	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balboa_(dance)

BOL	*Bolero* is unique among competitive American Rhythm dances in that it requires not only cuban motion, but contra body movement as found in the smooth dances and rise and fall as is found in the <//waltz>.   For the purpose of music4dance categorization Bolero is the slowest of the three competition dances that are danced to *Rumba* style music, the other two being the Rumbas from the <//International Latin> and <//American Rhythm> categories.    The Bolero is generally danced as the fourth dance of <//American Rhythm five dance> competitions.  	0702588e-05e6-49e1-9434-0a0d5090eb64	Wikipedia	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolero#American_Rhythm

ECS	*East Coast Swing* is a standardized dance in <//American Rhythm> style dancing as well as a social partner dance.  It is one of a number of different swing dances that developed concurrently with the swing style of jazz music in the mid twentieth century.  This group of dances also includes <//Lindy Hop>,  <//Carolina Shag>, <//Balboa>, <//West Coast Swing>, and <//Jive>.    The *East Coast Swing* is generally danced as the first dance of <//American Rhythm> competitions.  	4c33a167-e7e6-41e6-aafd-72eaf1629ce5	Wikipedia	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Coast_Swing

FXT	Foxtrot is the family of dances that developed in the nineteen tens and is danced to much the same music as the <//Swing> dances. Both the <//American Smooth> and the <//International Standard> competition rounds contain <//Slow Foxtrot>  and International style also contains a faster version of the *Foxtrot* called the <//Quickstep>. Other dances in this family include the <//Peabody> and the <//Castle Foxtrot>.	4fad1550-e0ca-47fc-b6a1-789dea71e67c	Wikipedia	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxtrot

LTN	In competitive ballroom dance the term Latin has a very specific meaning as the five dances that are danced as <//International  Latin Five Dance> round. This round consists of <//Cha Cha>, <//Samba>, <//Rumba>, <//Paso  Doble> and <//Jive>.    Since our main purpose is match music to styles of dance, this isn't a particularly useful categorization. Instead, we are broadly grouping the dance styles that derive from Spain and Latin America as Latin. This gives a useful spectrum of tempos of similarly styled music that can be mapped to the various *Latin* dances. Note that we've pulled out the <//Tangos> into their own category as there enough different styles of Tango each danced to similar music at slightly different tempi that they create a cohesive unit. There is some argument that the same should be done for other sub-groups of *Latin* dances and music.  For instance <//Bolero>, International <//Rumba> and American Rumba create a spectrum of  tempi from about 25 to 36 measures per minute all danced to a similar style music. And <//Samba> and <//Bossa Nova> create a natural subcategory of Brazilian music with a similar feel at different tempi.	54a8362f-9ab0-439d-97c0-b7e870796765	International Latin Round	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_DanceSport_dances#Latin
MBO	The *Mambo* is a fusion of Swing and Cuban music developed from Danzon and was heavily influenced by the Jazz musicians of the 1930s.  The competition dance was influenced by the Cuban music and style, but is formalized nearly beyond recognition.  It is characterized by breaking on the 2 in 4/4 time and a compact basic movement.	b066f19f-c35d-4a4a-9b35-2fb888bb783e	Wikipedia	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mambo_(dance)

RMB	There are two competition ballroom dances called *Rumba*.  One in the <//International Latin> round that based on what the Cubans called bolero-son and is danced in a similar pattern to the American Style <//Bolero> and the other in the <//American Rhythm> round which is danced to a faster beat and takes a box step as its basic figure.  The American Style Bolero (96-104 BPM), the International Rumba (100-108 BPM), and the American Rumba (120-144 BPM) are all in a subfamily of Latin dance that are danced to similar music at a range of tempi.	30f4859b-e897-4d21-9395-e6212fd0274a	Wikipedia	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumba_(dance)

SWG	The group of dance styles that are traditionally danced to <//Swing music> and trace their roots to the American nineteen twenties dance tradition centered in the [Savoy Ballroom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savoy_Ballroom) are collectively known as *Swing* dances. These dances range from formal ballroom dances in both <//American Rhythm> (<//East Coast Swing>) and <//International Latin> (<//Jive>) syllabi to the more social variants of <//Lindy Hop> and <//West Coast Swing>. There are also many regional variants of swing including but definitely not limited to <//Balboa> and <//Carolina Shag>.	32c84c48-40cb-49d8-8413-414d58282fab	Wikipedia	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_(dance)	61f200f1-6d4d-445d-8fda-9785891f3dc2	Savoy Ballroom	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savoy_Ballroom
SWZ	The Slow Waltz is a dance in 3/4 time and is characterized by its graceful rise and fall motion.  It is danced primarily in closed position to the music of the same name.  At music4dance, we're be consistently referring to this dance as the *Slow Waltz* to distinguish it from the <//Viennese Waltz> and other dances in the <//Waltz> family, but in the context of ballroom dancing when the term *Waltz* is used by itself, this is generally the dance that is being referenced.    The Slow Waltz is generally danced first in both the <//American Smooth> and <//International> Standard dance competitions.  	693e1bb7-9662-4117-9d9e-aeaab244f6c4	Wikipedia	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_waltz	3a8fc772-4e40-45d2-8bed-f8b18519a2fe	Technique	http://www.ehow.com/how_4302_waltz.html

TGO	*Ballroom Tango* is a dance descended from the dances of the same name in the Rio de la Plata region of South America.  It danced in 4/4 time and is characterized staccato movements and head snaps.    <//Tango> is generally danced second in <//American Smooth four dance> and <<//International Standard five dance> competitions and while these two dance styles are closely related they are definitely distinct styles.    	955cbd94-2861-4233-a733-3cf15d04449a	Wikipedia	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballroom_tango

VWZ	The *Viennese Waltz* is original style of <//Waltz>.  As with all waltzes it is danced in 3/4 time to music of the same name.  It is the first ballroom dance to be performed in the closed hold or "waltz" position and is distinguished from other *Waltzes* in that it is danced to a fast tempo and is strongly characterized by circular motion of the partners rotating around each other as they progress down line of dance.    *Viennese Waltz* is generally danced as the fourth and final dance in <//American Smooth four dance> and third in <//International Standard five dance> competitions.  	07f03c76-b300-447f-92fe-2897cb271af4	Basics	http://dance.about.com/od/partnerdancestyles/qt/Viennese_Waltz.htm	61b2ca63-453f-42fc-b3cf-3dc85743d049	History	http://www.austria.info/us/the-big-waltz-at-lincoln-center/history-of-the-viennese-waltz-1345134.html
