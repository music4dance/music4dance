<h3>What is Music4Dance.Net?</h3>
<ol class="round">
    <li class="one">
        <h5>It is an idea</h5>
        This is an early concrete representation of an idea that has been floating around in my head since I first started learning to ballroom dance in the early 1990s (man that was a long time ago).
        As someone with a fairly robust music background and a very robust foundation in computer science, it's always annoyed me that there isn't a good way to find music to dance to.
    </li>

    <li class="two">
        <h5>My first very small step</h5>
        The problem is, my grand vision of how to solve this problem requires <i>a lot</i> of moving parts.  But after reading The Lean Startup I decided to use this as a way of trying to bite off small chucks
        of a project to get a minimal usable product.  The result of this was a small windows phone 7 application that asks you to tap out the beat of a song that you're listening to and will show you 
        which dances in its database it would work for.  This is based entirely on tempo and meter and has nothing to do with the style of the song.
        <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/dancecalc/b414c752-cc97-e011-986b-78e7d1fa76f8">See the app…</a>
    </li>

    <li class="three">
        <h5>But not many people own windows phones</h5>
        Aside from the above being a very small part of the solution, the platform isn't a particularly good test case.  I chose it because I was interested in trying my hand at windows phone programming
        not because I thought it was the best initial platform.  One of my next steps will be to get the basic functionality for that application working on this web site.  
    </li>

    <li class="four">
        <h5>But what I really want to do</h5>
        Is to be able to generate a playlist of songs to dance a slow salsa or fast West Coast Swing or a Viennese Waltz to.  I'd like to do this against my own library or against one of 
        a multitude of streaming and mp3 purchase services.  The first baby step for that is the songs section of this website, where I've pulled together a bunch of that information 
        from a number of different sources, merged and edited, so that I've got at least a start of a database of song title/artist/albums associated with various dances.  In the long run I would like this
        to be both crowd sourced and linked to actual music, but for now enjoy the browsing.
